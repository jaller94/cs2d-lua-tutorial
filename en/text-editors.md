A text editor is the interface between computers and the developer. That's why it is important to use an editor which you are familiar with.

As a minimum the text editor should support syntax highlighting for lua and line breaks of Windows and Linux.

### Nano for the terminal
If you are running a Linux server you can use `nano` to quickly edit files.

nano sys/serverinfo.txt   # To create/modify of a specific file
```
